“Analyzing college library data: student visits, book borrowing, fines, and study patterns.”

This project analyzes how students use the college library. The goal is to understand borrowing habits, study behavior, visit frequency, and fine patterns using real dataset records.
By using data analysis, the project helps identify how different students interact with library resources.

What This Project Does: 

Cleans and organizes library usage data
Analyzes student borrowing behavior
Compares usage across departments and years
Studies relationship between study hours and visits
Identifies overdue books and fine patterns
Classifies students based on library usage level

Tools & Technologies Used :

Python – data processing
Pandas – data cleaning & analysis
